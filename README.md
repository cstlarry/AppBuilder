Java learning tool.  This tool is designed to be used with new java programming students to provide a simple project framework for their assignments.
AgeCalc.java is an example of how to use the framework.  The student adds code to the setup and the run method and those statements are executed when
the student presses the Run button.  Students can write their own methods after the run method if they need to.
